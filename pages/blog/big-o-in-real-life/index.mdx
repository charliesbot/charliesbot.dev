summary: How to apply the rules of Big-O in real-life examples?

In a [previous post](/blog/big-o-notation), I talked about Big-O and how it helps us measure our code's cost in the worst scenario.

One tricky thing to catch is the combination of multiple complexities happening in a single algorithm. Let's dig into it!

## Breaking our algorithm

First of all, let's settled down on the goal of this algorithm:

- The input is an array of unsorted numbers.
- The output will be the biggest number on the list.

```typescript

const numbers = [9, 1, 8, 0, 4, 15, 23, 6];

const getMaxNumber = (numbers: number[]): number => {
  // ???
}

getMaxNumber(numbers); // 23
```

There are several ways to accomplish this.
The question **Big-O** will answer is: *which option is optimal?*.


## First attempt
```typescript
// O(n²)
const bubbleSort = (list: numbers[]) => {
  const copyList = [...list];
  for (let i = 0; i < copyList.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < copyList.length; j++) {
      if (copyList[i] > copyList[j]) {
        let temp = copyList[i];
        copyList[i] = copyList[j];
        copyList[j] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  return copyList;
}

const getMaxNumber = (data: number[]) => {
  const sortedNumbers = bubbleSort(data);

  // O(1)
  return sortedNumbers[0];
}
```

Let's try this algorithm:
- Sort the values on the list
- Get the first value from the list, which will be the largest number
It looks simple, right? Let's code it and then measure its complexity.

In this attempt, I'm relying on a sorting technique called [Bubble Sort](https://medium.com/basecs/bubbling-up-with-bubble-sorts-3df5ac88e592).

Bubble Sort takes a value from the list, and then it compares it with the rest of the elements. If it finds a larger number (or smaller, depending on the condition), it swaps those values.

We have a loop that takes each number, and another nested loop compares that number with the rest of the elements on the list.

As we are nesting two loops, and each of them does the same action per entry, this piece of the algorithm has a complexity of `O(n²)`.

The last piece of the function gets the first entry of the sorted list. The complexity of this action is just `O(1)`.

The last step is to decide what is the overall complexity. Remember: Big-O is about the worst-case scenario, so we need to compare the complexities we found and take the worst one.

`O(1) < O(n²)`

`O(n²)` is the complexity of this algorithm.

## The second attempt - let's do better!

```typescript
const getMaxNumber = (data: number[]) => {
  // O(nlogn)
  const sortedNumbers = [...data].sort((a, b) => b - a);

  // O(1)
  return sortedNumbers[0];
}
```
In the former attempt, the bottleneck happens in the sorting. Bubble Sort is well known for its awful performance.
It turns out Javascript already has a sort method, and each browser engine uses a different algorithm. For example, Firefox implements [Merge Sort](https://medium.com/basecs/making-sense-of-merge-sort-part-1-49649a143478) for this method.
And Merge Sort has a **Big-O** of `O(nlogn)`.

Most of the sort algorithms have a complexity of `O(nlogn)`, by the way!

This complexity is because most of the sorting methods loop the array once.
In every step, they implement their way to sort sub pieces of the collection instead of repeatedly comparing each element.

The last step doesn't change. We still need to get the first entry of the sorted array.

`O(1) < O(nlogn)`

The complexity of this attempt is `O(nlogn)`.

It's better than the first attempt! But I know we can do better. Let's try one more time.

## The third time is the charm
```typescript
const getMaxNumber = (data: number[]) => {
  let max = -Infinity;

  // O(n)
  data.forEach((x) => {
    max = Math.max(x, max);
  })

  return max;
}
```

Let's step back and rethink the problem. Sorting the list makes sense, but it is adding overhead to our solution.
Do we really need to sort the array?
What if we:
- Declare a variable called *max*.
- Loop the array
- Every time we find a higher number than the one we stored in *max*, we replace *max* with that value.
Looping the array has a complexity of `O(n)` because we depend on the array's size. And reassigning the value when the condition applies has a complexity of `O(1)`.

`O(1) < O(n)`

The complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`. Much better!

## Conclusion
When we have several options to solve a problem, Big-O helps us decide from them by comparing their complexities.

We also had the chance to explore the complexities from a couple of standard algorithms, like Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

We even thought out of the box by finding a third solution that didn't require sorting at all!

That's the beauty of Big-O: it pushes us to find the pains of our code so that we can build better algorithms.

I hope you apply Big-O in your next algorithm.

Let me know how it goes!
