So, you built an amazing component using your favorite framework/library, let's say, React. A button, a dropdown, call it what you want.

It fitted perfectly in your project, and you are proud of what you did.

Then, a workmate see that component. That solves a problem her team has! When she tried to use it, she discovers a huge blocker.

Her team is using *Vue*.

## The framework dependence

React/Angular/Vue were pioneer of the component revolution. Their declarative API taught us how to create scalable elements. Props, lifecycles and more.

Some years later, we are using those tools for every single piece of our projects. Yes, to build everything.

Want a button? Let's use React for that.
What about a Label? Sure, let's Vue it.

And so on.

## The core problem

Let's say we're building a super button.

React:

```jsx
/* SupperButton.js */
const SuperButton =
	({ onClick }) => <button onClick={onClick}>Button</button>
```

Vue:

```html
/* SupperButton.vue */
<template>
	<button @click="onClick">
	  <slot>Button</slot>
	</button>
</template>
```

Even with a syntax that looks a little bit different, in essence, we're repeating most of the code in both solutions.

The core bones of each of those components are the same. We may prefer one approach or the other to handle business logic and the way the components relate to each other, but the soul of the building blocks are the same.

# A sharing problem

Most of the teams that I worked with built a component library to reuse everywhere. Funny thing is, each team redo this library according the tech stack they are using.

They are not looking for vanilla versions of bootstrap or material-design. They are looking for react-bootstrap, or react-material.

What if we could follow real standards to build the basics, and use these smart frameworks to orchestrate the use of them?

## Cause sharing components across realms is fun

Web components is a *kinda* new standard of the web.

They let us add new HTML Elements that the browser can understand natively.

That's right! You don't need a library or a framework to create components. Just some javascript and a good name for it.

Web components are identifiable because they have a dash (-) in its name.

```html
<super-button />
```

# Thousands of possibilities. A single API.

You probably have seen implementations of several design languages, like Material Design.

Isn't weird that there are libraries that covers each framework? React, Angular, Vue, you name it.
A button, a text area, or an input wrapped with some css to follow the conventions, and the framework interface to let us use it in our current projects.

Competition is great (and necessary!). But that's great if those implementations could be used no matter tech stack. We are talking about basic components, that shouldn't know the complexity of our app. Let's make that dream true.

# Come on! Let's find a wild component!

Let's work with that super button in mind.

```js
class SuperButton extends HTMLElement {
  get size() {
    return this.getAttribute("size") || "small";
  }

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.shadow.innerHTML += `
      <style>
        button {
          background-color: purple;
          color: white;
          border-radius: 2px;
        }
        .big {
          min-width: 200px;
          height: 100px;
        }
        .small {
          min-width: 100;
          height: 50;
        }
      </style>

      <button class="${this.size}">
        <slot />
      </button>
      `;
  }
}

window.customElements.define("super-button", SuperButton);

// <super-button size="big">I'm a super button!<super-button>
```

Let's see what is happening here!

There are two core concepts regarding Web Components.

## Custom Elemen by extending from HTMLElement
This let us create new elements that encapsulates our custom component.

## Shadow DOM
In the dark era of the web, an *iframe* was an option to scope CSS, HTML and JS.
Now that we are talking about web components, we would love accomplish the same, without using this hacky solution.

Luckily, we have now Shadow DOM, which let us do exactly that. It allow us to create fragments attached to a scoped host.

The big picture is: we're declaring a scope were our styles and dom is attached, and our styles, for example, won't clash
with others outside this scope.
This is a a big deal!

## Lifecycle
Web components have lifecycles! One of them is *connectedCallback*.

At the beginning, they are empty/undefined, and you may see that they flash while getting the resources and the styles.
When the component is ready, we're gonna receive a callback to start doing our own magic,
like reading attributes, for example.

# Tradeoffs

We may agree that the API is a little bit verbose. That's probably the main throwback if you are used to React or Vue, where defining a component and its props is easier and more declarative.

Fortunately, others developers are stepping up with solutions like Stencil or Svelte.
Tools that reduce the boilerplate without adding any dependency, as they act just as compilers.

# Sharing is caring

And we are ready to go!

This web component is ready to rock in every environment. It doesn't care about frameworks, it relies on native APIs!

Of course, I'm not implying we should stop using frameworks. React/Vue/Angular do way more that just components. They offer an all-in-one solution
and a lot of improvements and helpers that are extremely valuable to deliver solutions.

But when talking about the core bones of our application, web components make totally sense:
- If there are several teams in your company and want to maintain a single design system.
- If you want freedom to experiment with new technologies, and reuse the foundation.

As you can see, it's all about delegating the basics to the APIs the browser already deliver, and let the frameworks do the hard things.

# Last thoughts

So, you caught your first wild component. You can use it right now across frameworks. Isn't that cool?

Now imagine a world where we don't need to decide between react-material or vue-material, but just material-design with the same components experience.

Web components allow us to think entirely on components, and that's it.
The new discussions could be about a better technical decisions, but not about
- *How can we introduce this awesome component library to my current framework?*
- *Holy cow! A new framework is out! Time to rebuilt the component library from the ground up*

Start playing with it, and let me know what is your experience with it!
